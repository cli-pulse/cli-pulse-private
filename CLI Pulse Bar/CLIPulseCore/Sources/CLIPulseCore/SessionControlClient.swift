/// Phase 3 — Local Transport Foundation + Same-Mac Existing Session Control.
///
/// The macOS Sessions UI used to drive a single Supabase-backed surface
/// for every managed-session action (start / list / stop / send input).
/// That worked, but every keystroke against a session running on the
/// SAME Mac as the app paid a 1-3 s round-trip through Supabase. Phase 3
/// adds a same-machine Unix domain socket fast path. iOS / iPad / Watch
/// and cross-device Mac control keep using the existing remote path.
///
/// `SessionControlClient` is the small protocol the Sessions UI talks to.
/// It had two conformers until v1.52.1 retired the Supabase session plane;
/// one ships today:
///
///   * `LocalSessionControlClient` (macOS only) — talks to the helper
///     UDS server inside the app group container. Implements
///     `hello / ping / get_local_control_status / set_local_control
///     _enabled / start_session / list_sessions / stop_session /
///     send_input`.
///
/// The `capabilities` payload returned by `hello` is how the UI decides
/// what to enable per transport, NOT a hard-coded version check — a
/// future helper that gains `subscribeEvents` will surface it through
/// `capabilities` without an app update.
///
/// `listSessions` returns BOTH helper-owned managed sessions
/// (`controllable: true`) AND same-Mac processes the helper detected
/// via PR #14's `_should_ignore_command` + `_detect_provider`
/// (`controllable: false`). The latter are read-only by design — the
/// helper does not own those PTYs, so writing keystrokes / killing
/// arbitrary processes is unsafe and explicitly out of scope.
