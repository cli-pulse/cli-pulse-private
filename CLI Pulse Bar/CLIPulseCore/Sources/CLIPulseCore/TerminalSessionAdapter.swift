// v1.24 Phase 3 slice 3 — TerminalSessionAdapter.
// Owns the lifecycle wiring between a TerminalView (xterm.js
// frontend) and a LocalSessionControlClient (the helper RPC client
// that talks to ManagedSessionManager over UDS+JSON-RPC):
//
//   * Spawns a managed session via `start_session` RPC.
//   * Subscribes to that session's `output_raw` events (raw:true — ANSI
//     intact so the TUI renders); routes payload bytes to
//     `TerminalView.pushStdout`. Falls back to `output_delta` if raw is
//     unavailable (older helper).
//   * Forwards `TerminalView` delegate callbacks back over RPC:
//     stdin → `send_input_raw` (raw bytes preserve Ctrl-C),
//     resize → `resize` (TIOCSWINSZ).
//   * On detach (window close / explicit teardown), cancels the
//     event subscription and `stop_session`s the helper-side PTY.
//
// macOS-only because TerminalView is macOS-only.
