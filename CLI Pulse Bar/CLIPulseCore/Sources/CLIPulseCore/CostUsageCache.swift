/// Bump this every time `CostUsageScanner.Pricing.claudeModels` or
/// `codexModels` changes (entries added / removed / repriced).
///
/// Why: per-event cost is computed inside `parseClaudeFile` /
/// `parseCodexFile` and stored as `costNanos` in the per-day-model
/// bucket. The `entriesFromClaudeCache` reconstruction has a
/// fallback that re-runs `Pricing.claudeCostUSD` when the bucket's
/// summed `costNanos` is exactly zero — but that fallback gives the
/// WRONG answer once even one new event lands in a previously-zero
/// bucket: the bucket then has partial cost, the fallback is
/// skipped, and only the new events' contribution is reported.
///
/// Bumping this constant invalidates every saved cache file on
/// next `load()` (returns an empty cache), forcing the next
/// `scanClaudeProvider` / `scanCodexProvider` to re-parse every
/// JSONL file with the current pricing rules. ~200 files take
/// ~1-2 s on a paired developer machine — a fair price for
/// guaranteed-correct cost on the first refresh after an upgrade.
///
/// History:
///   1 — initial schema (no version field on disk; default Int = 0
///       on legacy files made them count as "stale" against this
///       constant, which is the desired behaviour).
///   2 — May 2026: `claude-opus-4-7` priced + family-fallback added
///       (PR fix-claude-usage-cost-accuracy). Caches written with
///       pricingVersion=0 had `costNanos=0` for every Opus 4.7
///       event; bump invalidates them so a normal refresh — not a
///       manual Force Rescan — produces correct Today/Week cost.
///   3 — Jul 2026: `claude-opus-4-8` priced with a dedicated entry.
///       Before this, the family fallback relabeled every opus-4-8
///       event `opus-4-7`, so the By-Model breakdown mis-attributed
///       ~all current Claude Code traffic. The stored per-file model
///       key is the normalized name, so a bump is required to re-parse
///       existing logs under the correct `opus-4-8` label.
///   4 — Aug 2026: the Claude 5 generation priced, and the pricing key
///       split away from the display name. Every cache written before
///       this holds `costNanos=0` for every `claude-opus-5`,
///       `claude-fable-5`, `claude-sonnet-5`, `gpt-5.6-sol` and
///       `gpt-5.6-terra` event — 15.47 billion tokens at zero on the
///       machine this was found on, every day since 2026-07-30. Same
///       failure as bump 2, one generation later: the family fallback
///       required a four-component `claude-opus-4-8` shape and the
///       generation bump dropped the fourth component. Without this
///       bump the fix would only apply to logs written from here on,
///       and every historical day would keep reading $0.
