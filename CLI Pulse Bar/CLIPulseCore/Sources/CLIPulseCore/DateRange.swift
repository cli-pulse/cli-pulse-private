/// (the rolling-week window accidentally spanned 8 calendar days when
/// someone used `-7` thinking inclusive math).
///
/// Convention for every helper here:
/// - The **rolling week** is today + the previous 6 calendar days = 7 days.
/// - The **rolling month** is today + the previous 29 calendar days = 30 days.
/// - `rollingWeekStart` / `rollingMonthStart` return the same HH:MM:SS clock
///   moment as the supplied `now`, just shifted back in whole days. Callers
///   that only need a calendar-day key should use `rollingWeekStartYMD`,
///   which formats via `ymd(...)` and discards the time component. All
///   current production callers compare via YMD strings.
