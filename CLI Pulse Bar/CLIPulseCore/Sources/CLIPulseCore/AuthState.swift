/// directly instead of going through the monolithic `AppState`.
///
/// `AppState` still owns the canonical instance (`public let authState`)
/// and exposes the 4 fields as computed forwarders for backward
/// compatibility with internal callers (`AuthManager.applyAuthenticatedState`,
/// `DemoDataProvider`, `DataRefreshManager` contexts) that already mutate
/// `self.isAuthenticated = …` etc. through AppState's implicit `self`.
///
/// Views that previously read `state.isAuthenticated` / `state.userName`
/// now declare `@EnvironmentObject var authState: AuthState` and read
/// `authState.isAuthenticated` / `authState.userName` — so a successful
/// login or pairing update no longer invalidates every AppState-observing
/// view in the tree.
