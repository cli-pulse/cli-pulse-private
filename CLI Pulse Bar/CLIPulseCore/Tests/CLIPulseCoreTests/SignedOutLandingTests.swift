/// post-sign-out / post-delete-account users land on an empty
/// "No Data Yet" view with no hint about what to do next; the iter14
/// "Continue without account" escape and the iter9 sign-in form both
/// live on the Settings tab, so that's the right landing.
///
/// iter19 (2026-04-29) note: the `restoreSession()` `.unavailable`
/// branch (cold launch with no stored token) ALSO sets
/// `selectedTab = .settings` directly — it was previously a `break`
/// no-op, which left the AppState init default `.overview` intact and
/// dropped fresh-install users onto a blank Overview. The iter19
/// behavior isn't unit-tested here because exercising it requires
/// touching live Keychain state (deleting the user's running tokens
/// to simulate "no stored token"), which would either break the dev
/// machine's session or be flaky depending on the order tests run.
/// The contract is verified by:
///   1. Code-level invariant — both `.unavailable` and `.failed`
///      branches now route to the same destination (.settings).
///   2. The tests below pinning `applySignedOutState → .settings`.
///   3. Manual real-device verification (open menu bar after fresh
///      install / Keychain wipe → land on Settings, not Overview).
///
/// `applySignedOutState` is `internal`, accessed via `@testable`. The
/// public `signOut()` wrapper would also exercise this, but it spawns
/// a Task to unregister the push token, so calling the inner reset
/// directly keeps the test deterministic.
