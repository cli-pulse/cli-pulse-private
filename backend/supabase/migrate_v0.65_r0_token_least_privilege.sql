-- v0.65 — R0: least-privilege realtime broadcast token (deep-audit 2026-07-04, F1)
-- Date: 2026-07-04 · *** LEDGER SAYS APPLIED — ITS OBJECTS WERE NOT THERE ***
--
-- ⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING ANYTHING BELOW. Corrected 2026-09-08.
--
--    `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` carries this file as
--    20260704045711. On 2026-09-07 production had NONE of what it creates: no
--    r0_broadcast role, neither oracle, and both realtime.messages policies
--    still at v0.56's inlined bodies. How that happened is not known and is not
--    guessed at; see migrate_v0.81's PROBLEM 1. The repair is v0.81 (applied)
--    plus v0.82 (still owed).
--
-- ⛔ ONE STATEMENT IN THIS FILE CANNOT WORK AND DOES NOT SAY SO:
--       line ~94   grant insert on realtime.messages to r0_broadcast;
--    realtime.messages is owned by supabase_realtime_admin, and `postgres` holds
--    INSERT WITHOUT grant option. PostgreSQL does not raise in that case — it
--    warns and returns success. Reproduced 2026-09-08 in a rolled-back
--    transaction: the grant reports success and has_table_privilege stays FALSE.
--    So this file's post-apply line `has_table_privilege(...,'INSERT') -- true`
--    is an expectation that cannot be met by the role that applies migrations
--    here. That is the single reason v0.82 exists as a separate file.
--
-- ✅ AND THE FALLBACK THIS FILE ALREADY RECORDS IS THE MORE LIKELY ANSWER.
--    Its own line ~65 says: "If Realtime rejects the custom role name, fall back
--    to a service-relay broadcast (helper→edge fn→service-role realtime.send)".
--    Measured 2026-09-08: service_role already holds INSERT on realtime.messages
--    and EXECUTE on realtime.send. That path needs no new privilege and no
--    support request. v0.82's header works through the trade-off.
--
-- Verified 2026-07-04 against prod (gkjwsxotmwrgqsvfijzs):
--   select count(*) from public.user_settings where realtime_private_enabled;  -- 0
-- The realtime_private cutover is OFF for 100% of users, so mint-realtime-token
-- produces NO live tokens and these policies/grants govern NOTHING until the
-- owner-gated cutover. Applying this changes ZERO current behavior.
--
-- ── PROBLEM (F1) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
-- mint-realtime-token signs an ES256 JWT with role='authenticated', sub=owner.
-- The dedicated R0 keypair is registered as a PROJECT-WIDE Third-Party trusted
-- issuer, so PostgREST (/rest/v1) trusts it too. A LEAKED minted token is thus
-- indistinguishable from the owner's own GoTrue session JWT: it carries
-- account-wide, owner-scoped PostgREST authority (every app RPC/table granted
-- `to authenticated` + RLS `auth.uid() = user_id`), not merely the ability to
-- broadcast a terminal stream. Confinement today is only the ~1h TTL and no
-- revocation. (The token is consumed by exactly ONE caller — the Python helper's
-- broadcast producer — as the Bearer on POST /realtime/v1/api/broadcast; it is
-- never used for PostgREST by our own code. So dropping `authenticated` is safe
-- for every real call site; mobile subscribers use their OWN login JWT.)
--
-- ── FIX ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- (1) Mint role='r0_broadcast' — a dedicated NOLOGIN role with ZERO privileges
--     on schema public (verified: cannot SELECT devices/remote_sessions/
--     user_settings, cannot EXECUTE delete_user_account or any remote_app_*).
--     Its ONLY reach is INSERT on realtime.messages (broadcast write). A leaked
--     r0_broadcast token can therefore only WRITE to its own pterm: topic — it
--     cannot read app data, cannot read other topics (no SELECT grant, and the
--     READ policy stays `to authenticated`), and cannot act as the owner via
--     PostgREST.
-- (2) Bind the token to the ONE session it was minted for: the WRITE policy now
--     additionally requires the topic to equal pterm:<the token's r0_session_id
--     claim>. This closes cross-session-WITHIN-owner (a token minted for
--     session A can no longer write to the owner's session B).
-- (3) Close the residual escalation surface reachable via the PUBLIC pseudo-role
--     (a custom role inherits PUBLIC grants). Three SECURITY DEFINER functions
--     are PUBLIC-granted AND scope by auth.uid(): a leaked r0_broadcast token
--     carries sub=owner, so it could invoke them AS the owner. Most damaging:
--     register_desktop_helper RETURNS a fresh helper_secret → a persistent
--     owner-impersonating device credential. These three are uid-scoped (they
--     `raise 'Not authenticated'` when auth.uid() is null), so their anon/PUBLIC
--     grants are DEAD (no anon caller can use them) and their real callers are
--     authenticated (the desktop app + the phone app). Re-scope them to
--     authenticated + service_role.
--
-- The READ (SELECT) policy is UNCHANGED (`to authenticated`) — the phone/desktop
-- subscribers read pterm: with their own GoTrue login token, not a minted token.
--
-- ⚠️ OWNER RUNBOOK — Supabase Realtime selects the Postgres role from the JWT
--    `role` claim ("inspects the `role` claim … to assign the correct Postgres
--    role when using … Realtime authorization") and evaluates realtime.messages
--    RLS via an insert-and-rollback under that role. This migration's DB-layer
--    mechanics are validated (r0_broadcast is grantable to `authenticator`,
--    which CAN `set role` into it; the WRITE policy admits it for its own
--    session topic and denies cross-session; it has no app-data reach). But
--    Supabase docs only DEMONSTRATE the three built-in roles and do not
--    explicitly bless a custom role NAME for the broadcast HTTP path. So BEFORE
--    the cutover (flipping user_settings.realtime_private_enabled), run the
--    end-to-end mint→broadcast integration check (owner runbook): mint an
--    r0_broadcast token and confirm POST /realtime/v1/api/broadcast to the
--    session's pterm: topic delivers (and a cross-session token does NOT). This
--    is the SAME integration gate migrate_v0.56 already requires (its Gemini
--    MEDIUM note). If Realtime rejects the custom role name, fall back to a
--    service-relay broadcast (helper→edge fn→service-role realtime.send) — no
--    user is affected either way because the path is gated OFF.
--
-- This whole script runs as ONE transaction.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- (1) Dedicated least-privilege role for realtime broadcast writes.
--     NOLOGIN: assumed only via the minted JWT's `role` claim (Realtime/
--     PostgREST `set role`). Idempotent.
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
do $$
begin
  if not exists (select 1 from pg_roles where rolname = 'r0_broadcast') then
    create role r0_broadcast nologin;
  end if;
end
$$;

-- The PostgREST/Realtime login role must be able to SET ROLE into r0_broadcast
-- (authenticator is NOINHERIT, so this grants SET-ROLE capability, not
-- inherited privileges — exactly what we want). Idempotent.
grant r0_broadcast to authenticator;

-- Minimal realtime grants: schema USAGE + INSERT on messages (broadcast write
-- ONLY — deliberately NO select/update, so a leaked token cannot even read
-- back other topics at the table level).
grant usage on schema realtime to r0_broadcast;
grant insert on realtime.messages to r0_broadcast;

-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- (2a) Authorization ORACLE for the broadcast write. The least-privilege
--      r0_broadcast role has NO SELECT on public.remote_sessions (by design),
--      so the WRITE policy CANNOT inline `select ... from remote_sessions` — a
--      policy expression is evaluated as the CURRENT role, and that would fail
--      "permission denied for table remote_sessions" under r0_broadcast. Wrap
--      the ownership+session+topic check in a SECURITY DEFINER function the
--      role can EXECUTE. It reads the per-request session GUCs (auth.uid() /
--      request.jwt.claims persist across a SECURITY DEFINER boundary) and
--      resolves remote_sessions as the definer.
--
--      Binds the token to the ONE session it was minted for: the topic must be
--      exactly pterm:<the token's r0_session_id claim>, that session must belong
--      to the token owner (auth.uid()=sub) and be realtime_private.
--
--      NEVER cast realtime.topic() (a ::uuid cast throws 22P02 on a malformed
--      topic → DoS). Compare constructed strings. Read the r0_session_id claim the
--      same robust way auth.uid() reads sub: nullif(...,'')::jsonb ->> key
--      (empty/absent → NULL → no match → fail closed).

-- (3) Re-scope the three PUBLIC-granted, auth.uid()-scoped SECURITY DEFINER

--     null) → their anon/PUBLIC grants are DEAD; real callers are authenticated
--     (register_desktop_helper: the desktop app; upsert_daily_usage /
--     get_daily_usage_by_device: the phone app). Idempotent.
