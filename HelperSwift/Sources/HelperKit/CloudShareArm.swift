/// points, plus the async→sync bridge the UDS layer needs.
///
/// Two mismatches make this indirection necessary, and neither is worth
/// restructuring the daemon over:
///
///  1. **Ordering.** `LocalSessionServer` is constructed and started BEFORE
///     `RemoteAgentCloud` — and the cloud arm only exists at all when the
///     helper is paired. The server's hook closure therefore has to resolve the
///     arm at CALL time, not at construction time.
///  2. **Concurrency domain.** `RemoteAgentCloud` is an actor, but the UDS
///     dispatch path is synchronous. Each connection runs on its own thread
///     (`LocalSessionServer.start()`), so blocking that thread on the actor
///     call stalls only the client that asked — which is exactly the semantics
///     a user's toggle wants anyway: it should not report success until the
///     cloud row actually exists.
///
/// While unpaired, `cloud` stays nil and the verb reports `not_implemented`
/// rather than flipping a local flag nothing would act on. Since the session
/// plane was retired the arm is ALWAYS unattached — the daemon never builds a
/// `RemoteAgentCloud` — so `setShared` reports the retirement rather than
/// blaming pairing for it.
