/// **Evolution rule — additive-only (long-standing practice, now
/// written down).** New `hello`/response fields MUST be added as
/// OPTIONAL on the decode side with a safe fallback, and both this
/// Swift helper and the Python helper (`local_session_server.py`)
/// MUST advertise them in lock-step. Never remove or repurpose an
/// existing key, and never make a client REQUIRE a field a shipped
/// helper predates — an older helper omits it entirely and a newer
/// helper's extra keys must be ignored by an older client. See the
/// optional `paired: Bool?` (v1.30.2) and `implementation: String?`
/// (v1.43) precedents: absent ⇒ nil ⇒ legacy behaviour.
///
/// `implementation` (v1.43, additive): identifies WHICH helper owns
/// the socket so the app stops nagging bundled users to "update" a
/// helper they can't update independently. This Swift helper only
/// ever ships EMBEDDED in the app bundle → it advertises
/// `"swift-bundled"`; the Python helper only ever ships via the
/// standalone `.pkg` → it advertises `"python-pkg"` (see
/// `local_session_server.py` hello). The two values are language-
/// tied ONLY because the distribution channels are today: if a Swift
/// helper is ever shipped via `.pkg`, revisit `HelperInstaller`'s
/// owner branching before flipping this string.

/// Protocol version pinned at 1 by iter1; iter2A bumped feature
/// surface but kept the version. Ports advertise this in `hello`.
public let kProtocolVersion: Int = 1

/// Semantic version of THIS (Swift) helper, advertised in the `hello`
/// reply as `helper_version` so the macOS app can compare the SOCKET
/// OWNER against the Claude-OAuth-injection floor (1.20.0).
///
/// Why this matters: the bundled Swift helper and the separately-
/// `.pkg`-installed Python helper bind the SAME UDS socket
/// (`clipulse-helper.sock`) and neither evicts a live peer — so on a Mac
/// with a stale pre-1.20.0 `.pkg` helper already bound at login, this
/// (newer) bundled helper cedes and the app talks to the OLD one, which
/// spawns `claude` on the Claude API instead of the user's Max plan.
/// Until this constant existed the Swift helper sent NO version, so the
/// app couldn't tell the bundled (injection-capable) helper from an
/// ancient one. Kept on the SAME version line as the Python helper
/// (`helper/system_collector.py:HELPER_VERSION`) so the app's single
/// floor comparison works for whichever helper owns the socket.
///
/// Drift used to be user-visible: `HelperInstaller.refresh()` compared the
/// socket owner's hello version against the published .pkg manifest, so a
/// stale value produced a PERPETUAL "Update available" nag the Update button
/// couldn't clear (installing the .pkg does not evict a bundled helper that
/// owns `~/.clipulse`). This slipped 1.23.0→1.29.1 unnoticed across six helper
/// releases; CI asserts the two lines match (`scripts/check_helper_version_sync.sh`).
///
/// v1.43: a `swift-bundled` hello owner now BYPASSES that manifest compare
/// entirely (`HelperInstaller.resolveState` → `.bundled`), so this constant no
/// longer drives the nag for the bundled helper. The compare still runs for a
/// `python-pkg` / pre-v1.43 owner (against its OWN reported version), and the
/// app's OAuth-injection floor gate reads `helper_version` for WHICHEVER helper
/// owns the socket — so keeping this in lock-step with the Python
/// `HELPER_VERSION` remains required (one version line across both channels).
