# Phase 4E Slice 4 follow-up (Codex P0 fix, 2026-05-07):
# Post-process an `xcodebuild archive`-produced .xcarchive to embed
# the Swift `cli_pulse_helper` LaunchAgent binary + plist into the
# .app inside the archive, sign the helper, re-sign the .app while
# preserving its existing entitlements (sandbox + app-group + .xcent
# Xcode emitted at archive time).
#
# `xcodebuild archive` does NOT trigger Run Script / Copy Files
# build phases for the Swift package's executable target unless those
# phases are wired into the Xcode project. The project has never
# had them — instead the canonical path was `scripts/build_signed_app.sh`
# which only handles Debug builds, not archives. The result was the
# Release archive (and consequently every ASC submission since v1.10)
# shipped without the LaunchAgent helper. Codex caught this on
# v1.13.0 archive verification.
#
# This script is invoked AFTER `xcodebuild archive` to enrich the
# archive in-place. CI / build-appstore.sh both call it.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/embed_helper_in_archive.sh <archive-path>
#
# The archive's app must already be signed by Xcode with the
# automatic signing flow — we re-sign with `--preserve-metadata=
# entitlements,requirements,flags` so the existing Xcode-emitted
# entitlements (and any provisioning profile binding) survive.

# v1.44: smoke the SIGNED helper's sensor path.
#
# The helper now links SensorKit, which resolves private IOReport / IOHID
# symbols through `-undefined dynamic_lookup` — there are no SDK stubs for
# them. build_helper_pkg.sh has carried the same guard for `clipulse-sensors`
# since it shipped, calling it "the scariest ship risk", and it is scarier
# here: `clipulse-sensors` is standalone, so if it fails to load the user just
# loses sensor readings, whereas these symbols now live in the helper itself
# and a load failure takes down sessions, hooks and approvals with it.
#
# This runs post-signing on purpose. Hardened runtime + codesigning is exactly
# the combination that could break dynamic_lookup, so smoking the unsigned
# binary would prove nothing. Covers both entitlement configurations, because
# MAS and DEVID both come through this script with different
# $HELPER_ENTITLEMENTS.
#
# Deliberately does NOT assert that sensors are non-null: a machine with no
# readable sensors is a legitimate state (the wire contract says `null`), and
# the CI runner is a VM. What must hold is that the binary LAUNCHES and emits
# a well-formed snapshot — that is what a dynamic_lookup failure destroys.
