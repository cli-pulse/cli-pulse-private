# Fail the build if the two helper version lines drift.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The bundled Swift helper (HelperSwift, `kHelperVersion`) and the .pkg Python
# helper (`helper/system_collector.py:HELPER_VERSION`) are kept "on the SAME
# version line" so the app has one coherent notion of "the helper version"
# regardless of which of the two owns the socket — the OAuth-injection floor
# gate reads `helper_version` for WHICHEVER helper answered hello, and (for a
# `python-pkg`/pre-v1.43 owner) refresh() compares that reported version against
# the published .pkg manifest.
#
# Historically a drift produced a PERPETUAL "Update available: <swift> →
# <python>" nag in Settings that the Update button couldn't clear — installing
# the .pkg does not evict a bundled helper that owns ~/.clipulse. This drifted
# 1.23.0 → 1.29.1 unnoticed across six helper releases (caught by the 1.42.0
# post-release audit, live-reproduced on real hardware).
#
# (v1.43: a `swift-bundled` hello owner now BYPASSES the .pkg-manifest compare
# entirely — HelperInstaller shows "built-in, updates with the app" — so this
# pin no longer drives the bundled-owner nag. It is still required for the
# python-pkg-owner compare and the floor gate above.)
#
# Like check_helper_no_container_touch.sh, the failure this guards against is
# invisible in CI and unit tests — it only appears in a shipped app's Settings
# pane. Pure grep; runs anywhere.
