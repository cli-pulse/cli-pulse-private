"""Managed remote-agent sessions — iter 1 of "Sessions Input".

Phase 1 (shipped in v1.11.0/44) only delivered remote APPROVALS through the
hook (`remote_hook.py`). iter 1 of Phase 2 adds **managed sessions** — the
helper actually spawns the provider CLI under a PTY so the app can:

  * Send free-text prompts via `RemoteCommandKind.prompt`.
  * Stop the session via `RemoteCommandKind.stop`.
  * Interrupt (SIGINT-equivalent) via `RemoteCommandKind.interrupt`.
  * Approve a permission request inline because the request's
    `session_id` matches the managed session row (the hook reads
    `CLI_PULSE_REMOTE_SESSION_ID` we set on the child env so this binding
    works without Claude having to know about us).

What this module does NOT do:

  * Spawn `codex` or `shell`. Codex/shell adapters remain Phase-2 stubs.
    The new `remote_app_request_session_start` RPC rejects providers
    other than `claude` server-side.
  * Upload stdout/stderr event tail. The cap is 4 KB / row and the
    plumbing is here, but iter 1 deliberately does not call
    `remote_helper_post_event` for stdout/stderr — only lifecycle
    `status` rows. Tail-streaming UI is a separate iter.
  * ConPTY (Windows). `RemoteAgentManager` accepts the transport via
    dependency injection; the cli-pulse-desktop track will plug in the
    Windows transport against the same protocol (see
    `helper/transports/conpty.py`).

Privacy / security posture (unchanged from Phase 1):
  * Default OFF. The helper RPCs are gated by
    `_remote_authenticate_helper_gated`. If the user toggles Remote
    Control off mid-session, `remote_helper_pull_commands` raises and
    the manager catches → no further dispatch happens until the user
    re-enables.
  * v1.55 (Companion CLI 1.31.0): every call this manager makes to our
    server asks `uploads_allowed` first, the same rule as the helper's
    heartbeat and sync (`cli_pulse_helper._remote_server_calls_allowed`).
    While the Mac app is signed out, in another account, used without an
    account, set to "Not now", or unreadable, nothing is sent: no session is
    registered, and a running session's output, status and notes are not
    posted. The sessions themselves keep running on this Mac.
  * Free-text prompt payload is whatever the user typed; we do NOT
    filter or transform it before write_stdin. If the user typed a
    high-risk shell command, Claude Code's own permission prompt fires
    when Claude tries to run it, and that prompt round-trips through
    the existing hook → remote-approval surface. (Shell provider is
    deferred and MUST add a high-risk filter on the prompt payload
    before it ships.)

        redaction; caller can re-stash the original (un-redacted) bytes
        on the per-session `stdout_buffer` if it wants to retry next
        tick. iter 2 chooses NOT to retry on failure: events are
        ephemeral by retention design (7-day cron prune) and re-stashing
        un-redacted bytes risks DoS-amplifying a long upload outage
        into unbounded memory growth.
