"""Helper-side Unix domain socket server for local control.

Phase 3 — "Local Transport Foundation" (Iter 1) plus the next slice
that lets the macOS app drive same-Mac existing sessions (Iter 2A).

Wire format:
    [4-byte big-endian uint32 length] [UTF-8 JSON request body]

A single connection may carry multiple sequential request/response
pairs (no pipelining: client sends one frame, waits for the reply, then
sends the next). The 4-byte length cap is enforced symmetrically — both
read and write reject anything > 1 MiB without writing it.

Request envelope:
    {
        "id": "<opaque correlation id, echoed in reply>",
        "method": "hello" | "ping" | "get_local_control_status" |
                  "set_local_control_enabled" |
                  "start_session" | "list_sessions" | "stop_session" |
                  "send_input",
        "auth_token": "<base64 helper-auth-token>",
        "params": { ... method-specific ... }
    }

Reply envelope (success):
    { "id": "<echoed>", "ok": true, "result": { ... } }

Reply envelope (error):
    { "id": "<echoed>", "ok": false, "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }

Error codes (stable contract — Swift `LocalSessionControlClient` maps
each one to a typed error case):

    "unauthenticated"     bad / missing / mismatched auth_token
    "version_mismatch"    client requested an unsupported protocol
    "not_implemented"     known method, not in this iteration's caps
    "local_control_off"   helper config has local_control_enabled = false
    "internal"            executor raised; details elided to message
    "bad_request"         malformed JSON or missing required field
    "unknown_method"      method string is not one of the documented set
    "frame_too_large"     declared length > MAX_PAYLOAD
    "frame_truncated"     stream closed mid-body
    "session_not_found"   send_input / stop_session referenced an id
                          that has no record in either the managed
                          set or the detected set
    "not_controllable"    the id IS visible (detected via process
                          scanning) but the helper does not own its
                          PTY, so write/stop is not safe to attempt
    "process_not_found"   kill_process referenced a pid that does not
                          exist (or vanished before the kill)
    "process_protected"   kill_process target is pid ≤ 1, a critical
                          system process (kernel_task/launchd/…), or the
                          helper itself
    "process_not_permitted" kill_process / signal_process target is owned by
                          another user / root (same-UID only)
    "rate_limited"        too many process actions in the rate window
                          (shared budget across kill + suspend + resume)

Auth posture
============

`hello` is the ONE method that may be called without a valid
`auth_token` — the client uses it to negotiate protocol / capabilities
before signing its first real call, AND to detect "helper not
running" without first needing the on-disk token to exist. Every
other method, including `ping`, requires a matching auth_token.

(Iter 1 of this branch let `ping` slip through unauthenticated; that
gave any local process a free liveness probe of the helper. The Codex
review caught it; this iteration tightens the policy to "hello-only
bypass". `ping` is still cheap and useful — clients just have to
include the token.)

Capabilities
============

The `hello` reply advertises a `capabilities` map the macOS UI uses
to gate features:

    {
        "send_input":        true,    # iter 2A: managed sessions accept stdin
        "subscribe_events":  false,   # iter 2A+: streaming output (deferred)
        "approvals":         false,   # iter 2B: hook approvals (deferred)
    }

Listing existing same-Mac sessions
==================================

`list_sessions` returns BOTH:
  * `managed`: sessions this helper spawned via `start_session` —
    full lifecycle control (start / list / stop / send_input).
  * `detected`: same-Mac processes the helper's existing
    `_should_ignore_command` + `_detect_provider` classifier
    (PR #14) recognises as Claude. **Read-only**: the helper does
    not own these PTYs, so `send_input` and `stop_session` against a
    detected-but-not-managed id are rejected with
    `session_not_found`. Listing is safe; arbitrary writes to a
    user terminal are not.
