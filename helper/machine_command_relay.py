"""Machine-command relay (v1.41 "Mobile Machine", Track B helper side).

Bridges the cloud `machine_commands` queue to the Mac APP executor. The Python
helper CANNOT speak NSXPC to the root fan daemon, so it does NOT execute fan/LPM
commands itself — it only RELAYS:

  * daemon loop (~1 Hz) → `pull_from_cloud()` drains pending machine commands
    from Supabase (`remote_helper_pull_machine_commands`) into a local queue,
    but ONLY when the Mac app executor is alive + opted-in (see `should_pull`).
  * Mac app (DEVID, `RemoteMachineExecutor`) polls the UDS ~2 s:
      - `pull_machine_commands`         → `drain_for_app()` hands over the queue.
      - `report_machine_control_state`  → `report_control_state()` records the
        executor's live {remote_fan, remote_lpm, boost_active, boost_target_rpm}.
      - `complete_machine_command`      → `complete()` writes the typed result
        back to Supabase (`remote_helper_complete_machine_command`).
  * v1.55 (Companion CLI 1.31.0): both calls to our server, the pull and the
    completion, ask `uploads_allowed` first, the rule the helper's heartbeat
    and sync follow (`cli_pulse_helper._remote_server_calls_allowed`). While
    the Mac app is signed out, in another account, used without an account,
    set to "Not now", or unreadable, neither is sent.
  * the heartbeat folds `heartbeat_metrics_fragment()` into `p_metrics` so the
    phone renders ONLY the controls the Mac will honor (honest capability map)
    and sees honest fan-boost state.

WHY gate pulling on a fresh executor report: a fan command must never be pulled
(→ marked `delivered`) when no executor is around to run it — it would be
orphaned instead of expiring server-side (60 s). So the relay only pulls after
the executor has reported within `_CONTROL_FRESH_S`. When the executor goes away
(app quit / opt-in off), the fragment actively clears `machine_controls` + boost
so the phone HIDES the controls rather than showing stale ones.

The fan dead-man heartbeat NEVER lives here — it stays in the Mac app executor +
the root daemon (2.5 s beat / 8 s dead-man). This relay carries requests only.

Thread-safety: the daemon loop (pull + heartbeat) and the UDS connection threads
all touch this concurrently; ONE lock guards all mutable state. Every method is
fail-soft — a relay error must never break the heartbeat or the daemon loop.
