"""Local approval registry for Phase 3 Iter 2B.

A managed Claude session can ask the user for permission before running a
tool (Read, Bash, etc.). When the helper spawned that Claude process, we
own a same-Mac fast path and want the macOS app to show those requests
inline rather than round-tripping through Supabase. This registry is the
helper-side state that backs that surface.

Two security checks gate every hook ingress:

  1. **Per-session capability token** — generated per managed session,
     passed to the Claude child via the env vars
     `CLI_PULSE_LOCAL_SESSION_ID` and `CLI_PULSE_LOCAL_HOOK_TOKEN`. The
     hook reads them at request time and presents them to the helper.
     Prevents cross-session forgery (Claude session A's hook cannot
     create a pending approval bound to session B because its env
     doesn't carry B's token).

  2. **Process-descent verification** — the UDS server pulls the peer
     PID off the connection (macOS `LOCAL_PEERPID`, Linux
     `SO_PEERCRED`) and walks the parent chain to confirm the
     connecting hook is a descendant of the Claude PID this helper
     recorded for the session. Defeats any-other-process forgery
     even if the capability token leaks (e.g. via env-var inspection
     by an unrelated process on the same Mac).

The two checks are belt-and-suspenders: each one closes a hole the
other doesn't. Same-session Claude tools necessarily inherit the env
and live in the descent tree, so they pass both — but that's intrinsic
to the trust model the user accepts when they type `claude` (already
true today for the existing `helper_secret`-based remote-approval
hook). The token is *session-scoped*, not *Claude-secret*, and the
PR description spells that boundary out in the security model.

The registry is **in-memory only**. A helper restart drops every
capability token AND every pending approval; the hook fails closed
(the catch-all fallback in `remote_hook.py` emits a local prompt).
This is the right durability story for a security-sensitive surface:
nothing on disk to leak, and the user sees the local prompt instead
of an unbounded silent retry.

Approval data the registry stores per pending row is intentionally
minimal:

    - approval_id (helper-generated UUIDv4, unguessable)
    - session_id (UUID of the managed session)
    - kind / type (e.g. "PermissionRequest" — string label only)
    - title + summary (single short lines, redacted by the caller)
    - tool_metadata (already-redacted dict; raw payloads must NOT be
      passed in — see `provider_adapters.claude` for the redaction
      that lives upstream)
    - status (pending → approved | rejected | expired | cancelled)
    - created_at + optional expires_at (monotonic + wall-clock)

The registry never logs the capability token, never embeds it in
events, and never returns it to the macOS app.
