"""Claude OAuth token resolution for managed sessions (v-next P0-A).

A managed `claude` session needs a *valid* OAuth access token at spawn
time. On this class of macOS install the keychain item
``Claude Code-credentials`` can hold an EXPIRED access token with an EMPTY
``refreshToken``, while ``~/.claude/.credentials.json`` (the file) holds
the real, refreshable credential. claude reads the keychain first and
cannot self-refresh from an empty refresh token, so a launchd-spawned
claude presents a stale bearer and 401s ("Please run /login").

This module resolves a fresh access token by:

  1. reading the credential **file-first** (the file holds the refresh
     token; keychain is the fallback source),
  2. **refreshing** via Anthropic's OAuth token endpoint when the access
     token is expired — the request REQUIRES the public Claude Code
     ``client_id`` and the endpoint ROTATES the refresh token,
  3. **persisting** the rotated credential back to the file atomically
     (temp + rename, 0600, preserving every other field), so the next
     spawn doesn't refresh again and the rotated refresh token survives,
  4. returning the fresh access token for FD/env injection into the
     spawned child (``RemoteAgentManager._inject_provider_auth``).

Request shape + FD-injection were proven on-device 2026-06-20 — see the
``feedback_managed_claude_agy_auth`` memory. This module NEVER logs the
raw token.
