# CLI Pulse Agent Guide

This file is the canonical quick-start context for any AI or automation working
in this repository.

## Product State

CLI Pulse is a paid iOS product and an in-progress macOS product.

Current active architecture:

- `CLI Pulse Bar/`
  - Main app codebase for macOS, iOS, watchOS, widgets, and the shared
    `CLIPulseCore` package
- `helper/`
  - Local helper CLI used for pairing, daemon sync, local provider detection,
    and quota collection
- `backend/supabase/`
  - Active backend contract: SQL schema, migrations, and RPC definitions
- `docs/`
  - Public website/legal/distribution pages used by GitHub Pages

## Repository Visibility Rule

This product should be treated as **closed-source product code**.

Do not assume the public GitHub repository should contain full source.

### Must stay private

- `CLI Pulse Bar/`
- `helper/`
- `backend/` except public-facing legal/distribution docs
- `archive/`
- test fixtures and provider parsing logic
- anything that reveals helper behavior, quota logic, cookie/keychain access,
  sync contracts, provider integrations, release internals, or product IP

### Can be public

- `docs/index.html`
- `docs/privacy.html`
- `docs/terms.html`
- public download links and release notes
- support and marketing content

## Git Rules

- `origin` is the private source repository.
- `public` is the public distribution repository.
- Do **not** push product source changes to `public` unless the task is
  explicitly about public website/distribution content only.
- Treat the public repo as distribution-facing unless explicitly told
  otherwise.
- Before any push, check whether the target remote is `origin` or `public`.
- The public `main` branch has been rewritten to distribution-only history.
- Public releases/tags are expected to point to distribution-only commits, not
  source commits.

## Branching Rule

- Treat private `main` as the integration branch.
- Start normal feature work from private `main`, not from older task branches.
- Use one task branch per unit of work, for example:
  - `onboarding-pairing-ux`
  - `provider-fix-gemini`
  - `release-1-1-4`
- Do not stack unrelated work onto `provider-sync-repo-cleanup` or other
  long-lived branches unless the intent is to ship those changes together.
- Keep public distribution work isolated from app/helper/backend feature work.
- If the user gives a new task without specifying a branch, inspect the current
  branch and decide:
  - same task family as current branch: reuse it
  - unrelated task: create a new task-named branch from private `main`
  - release work: use a release branch
  - public docs/distribution work: use the `public` workflow only
- Prefer opening a new branch over silently mixing unrelated work into an old
  feature branch.

## Current Repo Reality

- `origin` points to the private `cli-pulse-private` repo.
- `public` points to the public `cli-pulse` repo.
- Public GitHub Pages and GitHub Releases are still used for:
  - website pages
  - legal pages
  - macOS release downloads
  - support links
- Public repo contents are intentionally minimal:
  - `.gitignore`
  - `README.md`
  - `PRIVACY.md`
  - `TERMS.md`
  - `docs/`

## Public Release Workflow

If a task is specifically about the public repo, keep it distribution-only.

- Update website/legal/support content only.
- Upload notarized macOS artifacts to GitHub Releases in `public`.
- Do not add app source, helper source, backend code, tests, fixtures, or
  internal notes to `public`.
- If a release tag must be recreated, ensure it is recreated on a
  distribution-only commit.

## Active vs Archived

### Active

- `CLI Pulse Bar/`
- `helper/`
- `backend/supabase/`
- `docs/`
- `PRIVACY.md`
- `TERMS.md`

### Archived or historical

- `archive/legacy-root/`
- `archive/backend-fastapi-legacy/`

## Current Technical Direction

- App auth and sync are Supabase-based
- Cloud Sync is account-based, not direct device-to-device pairing
- The Mac helper is the source of local collection and sync
- Claude, Gemini, Codex, and other provider collectors are implemented inside
  `CLIPulseCore` and helper-side parsing logic

## Safe Validation Commands

Run these before shipping collector or helper changes:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q helper/test_system_collector.py
swift test --package-path "CLI Pulse Bar/CLIPulseCore"
```

When touching `backend/supabase/` SQL, app/helper/Android RPC call sites,
or edge functions, also run the static contract smoke (no network, no
credentials):

```bash
python3 backend/supabase/ci_check_rpc_contract.py
```

### Android validation (requires Java runtime)

```bash
cd android && ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

If the machine lacks a Java runtime, state this explicitly rather than
skipping Android validation silently.

### Live integration tests

The default `swift test` run is deterministic and offline. To also run
the live Claude collector chain (requires real credentials on the machine):

```bash
RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1 swift test --package-path "CLI Pulse Bar/CLIPulseCore"
```

### Backend SQL validation

There is no automated SQL test runner yet. When touching files in
`backend/supabase/`, manually verify:

- SQL syntax via `psql` or Supabase dashboard query editor
- RPC contracts match app/helper call sites
- Migration ordering is consistent with `schema.sql`

### Migration numbering — one number, one migration, forever

**Before you name a new `backend/supabase/migrate_vX.YY_*.sql`, run:**

```bash
ls backend/supabase/migrate_v*.sql | sort -V | tail -5
```

Take the next unused number. Never reuse one, **even if the existing file is on
a branch you have not merged yet** — parallel work is normal here and two
sessions picking "the next number" at the same time is exactly how this breaks.

Why it matters: these files are the only record of what has actually been
applied to production, and they are matched **by number**. Two different
migrations sharing a number means nobody can later answer "did v0.70 run?" —
the answer becomes "which v0.70?". The database will not stop you: both apply
cleanly, and the damage only surfaces months later during an incident.

If your branch already carries a number that has since been taken on `main`,
**renumber yours** — `main` wins, because its migration has usually already
been applied to production. Rename the file, update any reference to it, and
say so in the PR.

CI enforces this: `scripts/check_migration_numbers.sh` fails the build on a
duplicate. Run it locally before pushing.

**Real example this rule came from (2026-07-28):** `main` had
`migrate_v0.70_device_app_version.sql`, already applied to production, while
PR #393 independently added `migrate_v0.70_provider_accounts.sql`. Different
schema, same number, neither author aware. Caught by review, not by tooling —
hence the CI guard.

## If You Are a New AI Starting Work

1. Read this file first.
2. Read `/Users/jason/Documents/cli pulse/README.md`.
3. Read `/Users/jason/Documents/cli pulse/REPO_VISIBILITY_STRATEGY.md` (untracked-local; canonical copy: cli-pulse-internal/private-repo-root-docs/).
4. Read `/Users/jason/Documents/cli pulse/BRANCHING.md` before starting a new
   task branch or reusing an existing branch.
5. Read `/Users/jason/Documents/cli pulse/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md` (untracked-local; canonical copy: cli-pulse-internal/private-repo-root-docs/) before doing
   release or distribution work.
6. Treat the app/helper/backend logic as private product IP.
7. Do not publish source changes to the public repo by default.
