# CLI Pulse

Real-time usage, cost and quota tracking for AI coding tools — Claude Code,
Codex, Gemini, Cursor, Copilot and 45 others — across a macOS menu bar app,
iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Android, with a shared account so history follows
you between devices.

## Install

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **App Store** — iPhone · iPad · Watch · Mac | search "CLI Pulse" |
| **Homebrew** (macOS) | see below |
| **Developer ID DMG** (macOS, notarized) | [cli-pulse-distrib releases](https://github.com/cli-pulse/cli-pulse-distrib/releases/latest) |
| **Android** | [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clipulse.android) · or sideload the APK from [releases](https://github.com/cli-pulse/cli-pulse/releases) |
| **Windows · Linux** | [cli-pulse-desktop](https://github.com/cli-pulse/cli-pulse-desktop) |

```bash
brew tap cli-pulse/tap
brew trust cli-pulse/tap
brew install --cask cli-pulse
```

`brew trust` is not optional. Homebrew 6 refuses to load casks from a
third-party tap until it is trusted, so without it the install stops silently
after `brew tap`.

The rest of this file is for people working on the code.

This workspace contains the current `CLI Pulse Bar` app plus a small amount of
legacy material kept for reference.

## Platforms

CLI Pulse ships as one product across desktop, mobile, and wearable
platforms, with a shared Supabase backend so usage history follows you
between devices:

| Platform                        | Source                                                                      | Distribution        |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| macOS · iOS · iPadOS · watchOS  | this repo (`CLI Pulse Bar/`)                                                | App Store           |
| Android                         | this repo (`android/`)                                                      | Google Play         |
| **Windows · Linux**             | **[cli-pulse/cli-pulse-desktop](https://github.com/cli-pulse/cli-pulse-desktop)** (separate repo, Rust + Tauri 2) | GitHub Releases     |

The Windows / Linux build lives in its own repository because it shares no
client code with the Apple/Android apps (Rust + Tauri vs Swift/Kotlin) and has
a different CI matrix and release channel. Both desktop clients (macOS Swift
and Windows/Linux Rust) implement the same on-device JSONL scanner with
bit-exact parity, and every client authenticates against the same Supabase
project.

## 🔒 Privacy

- **Provider API keys & session cookies** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google,
  OpenRouter, ...) are stored only in macOS Keychain and **never uploaded**.
  They go directly from your device to the provider's own API.
- **Session log contents** under `~/.codex/sessions/` and `~/.claude/projects/`
  are scanned **on-device** via security-scoped bookmarks you grant in
  Settings. File contents never leave your Mac.
- **Aggregated usage metrics** (token counts, cost estimates, model names,
  dates) are synced to your CLI Pulse account so iPhone and Apple Watch show
  the same history. Linked to your user ID; no third-party analytics SDKs.
- **Yield Score git tracking** is opt-in. When on, only the commit hash, an
  HMAC of the project path, the commit timestamp, and a merge-commit flag
  upload. Messages, diffs, file paths, and author identity never upload.

## Current Product Structure

- `CLI Pulse Bar/`
  - Current Xcode workspace and app targets for macOS, iOS, Watch, Widgets, and
    the shared `CLIPulseCore` package.
- `helper/`
  - Current helper CLI used for pairing, daemon sync, and local provider
    collection.
- `backend/supabase/`
  - Active SQL schema, migrations, and RPC definitions used by the app and
    helper when talking to Supabase.
- `docs/`
  - Published static site assets, including `privacy.html`, `terms.html`, and
    `index.html`, which are linked from the shipping app.

## Current Development Commands

### App

Open the current app workspace:

```bash
open "CLI Pulse Bar/CLI Pulse Bar.xcodeproj"
```

### Helper

Run helper tests:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q helper/test_system_collector.py
```

Inspect local collection output:

```bash
python3 helper/cli_pulse_helper.py inspect
```

Run one sync:

```bash
python3 helper/cli_pulse_helper.py sync
```

### Shared Swift Package

Run the shared package tests:

```bash
swift test --package-path "CLI Pulse Bar/CLIPulseCore"
```

### Android

Run Android unit tests (requires Java runtime):

```bash
cd android && ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

## Legacy or Reference Areas

- `archive/`
  - Archived drafts, old projects, and working notes that are no longer part of
    the active product path.
  - `archive/backend-fastapi-legacy/` contains the older FastAPI runtime and its
    tests.

## Notes

- If you are looking for the current shipping code, start in `CLI Pulse Bar/`.
- If you are looking for pairing or provider collection logic, start in
  `helper/`.
- If you are looking for the live backend contract, start in
  `backend/supabase/`.
- If you are preparing a release, read `AGENTS.md` and the `appstore-submit`
  skill. (`RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md` was referenced here for a long time and has
  never existed in this repo.)
- If you are starting a new task branch, read `BRANCHING.md`.
- If you are handing a new task to another AI, use `TASK_START_PROMPT.md`.
- If you are asking an AI to commit, merge, or decide whether public updates are needed, read `MERGE_AND_PUBLISH_RULES.md`.
